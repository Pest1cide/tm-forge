The Font Awesome plugin

**High quality web icons for TeXmacs**

This plugin implements suitable TeXmacs macros to access the ~640 web-related 
icons provided by the included [*Font Awesome*](http://www.fontawesome.io) free 
font set, designed by Dave Gandy and released under the open [SIL Open Font 
License](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).

# Usage

The plugin can be installed by just linking this directory from 
`$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins`. An additional package `fontawesome` will appear 
in the packages menus. Add it to your TeXmacs document and you can access the 
icons using the macro `<aw|icon-name|relative-size>`.

The two parameters are the name of the icon and the size relative to the 
current font size. The full list of icons is showcased [in the 
documentation](fontawesome.en.tm). There is a PDF version 
[here](./docs/fontawesome.pdf).
